# Kick-Off Facts!!

A fun web application that generates random soccer-related facts, tracks the progress with a slider, and triggers confetti with a "SIUUUU!" animation when a specific milestone (FUN FACT #7) is reached. The app also allows users to toggle between light and dark modes.

## Features
- **Random Fact Generator**: Click the "Generate Fact!" button to show a random soccer fact.
- **Slider Progress**: Tracks the fact number visually using a slider. 
- **Confetti & Animation**: Fun confetti animation and "SIUUUU!" popup when the slider reaches "FUN FACT #7".
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark themes using the theme toggle button.
- **Clear Fact Button**: Clears the current fact and resets the slider and fact counter.

## How to Use
1. **Generate Fact**: Click the "Generate Fact!" button to display a new random soccer fact. Each fact is associated with a number, displayed as "FUN FACT #X".
2. **Slider**: The slider will update to show the current fact's progress. It ranges from "FUN FACT #1" to "FUN FACT #8".
3. **Confetti**: When the slider reaches "FUN FACT #7", the confetti will trigger and a "SIUUUU!" popup will appear.
4. **Clear Fact**: You can reset the facts by clicking the "Clear Fact" button, which will reset the fact counter, slider, and text.
5. **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes using the theme toggle button at the top-right corner.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Markup for the page structure.
- **CSS**: Styling for the webpage, with custom styles for both light and dark modes.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the random fact generation, slider update, confetti effects, and theme toggle.
